# 👋 Hey, I'm Samson (Sami) Kifle

I'm a self-taught automation builder and Computer Science student based in Lublin, Poland. I learned to code while driving taxis full-time, using tech to solve real-world problems.

This is a portfolio of my automation, data, and AI-related projects — each one built from real needs, not just tutorials.
